        <h3>Passion to Practice</h3>
        <div class = "contentwrap">

        <p>I've wanted to be a content creator for a long time, but I never knew where to start. This semester, I decided to finally take a step toward that goal by enrolling in MI334: eSports Broadcasting and Media. The class is focused on teaching the fundamentals of streaming and digital media in the gaming world. We've been learning how to set up and use streaming software, manage brand imaging, and present ourselves professionally online. A big part of the course also involves practicing how to speak clearly on camera and provide commentary during gameplay—skills that are a lot harder than they look but essential if you want to connect with an audience. What I like most about MI334 is how practical it is. Instead of just talking about the industry, we're getting hands-on experience with the same tools and techniques that real streamers use. Every assignment feels like another piece of the puzzle I'll need if I want to build my own channel and grow a community around it. For me, this class is more than just another requirement. It's the first structured step I've taken toward something I've wanted for years. Content creation has always been a dream, and now I finally feel like I'm gaining the skills and confidence to make it happen. Below is a table of my starting statistics. Throughout the semester, I will update my progress to compare at the end.</p>

        <h3>Scottage Sweets</h3>
        <div class = "contentwrap">
        <img src="imgs/baking.jpg" alt="cupcakes" style="height:200px" class = "titleimg">
        <p>	In Alma, Michigan—known locally as “Scotland, USA”—my mom, Shannon, decided to turn her love for baking into something bigger. She has always enjoyed baking for friends and family, but one morning she started thinking about how she could share her sweets with more people. That idea became Scottage Sweets.Scottage Sweets isn't a storefront. It runs out of her home kitchen, where she's spent years experimenting with recipes and creating treats that fit different needs. What makes her baking unique is her focus on alternative desserts. Instead of sticking only to traditional recipes, she creates options that are gluten-free, dairy-free, or naturally sweetened. The goal is simple: to make desserts that more people can enjoy, no matter their dietary restrictions.The name “Scottage Sweets” is a mix of Alma's Scotland nickname and the cozy, cottage-style feel of baking at home. It reflects exactly what the project is about—local roots, homemade care, and a welcoming atmosphere.For Shannon, this is more than baking. It's about making people feel included and giving them a chance to enjoy something special. Scottage Sweets is still small, but it already shows how a simple idea, started at a kitchen table, can grow into something meaningful. What began as one person's love for baking is now a way to share kindness, creativity, and community—one dessert at a time.</p>
